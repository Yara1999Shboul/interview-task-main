- Describe in your own words what is z-score and Min-Max scaling and why would we need to use such normalization methods? describe by example, if possible.
```
-z-score : it's a way to compare data and how the data is away of the mean.
-min-max scaling : to convert data from actual range to standard range [0,1].
-we need to use normalization because there is data come with strange distribution, so the 
 normalization technique will make these data come with normal distribution that will
 improve the performance and make it easier to deal with data.
